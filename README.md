## Description

I developing a web portal using Express server that functions as a Content Management System (CMS). It will enables user registration and login through session management. Users can create, edit, and delete posts stored in a database. The system utilizes controllers to manage routes and SQL queries via Sequelize and MySQL2. The front-end is supported by Handlebars, and communication with the back-end follows the Restful paradigm.
